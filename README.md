## Architecture
![Alt text](arquitectura.png?raw=true "Arquitectura")

Steps:
1. Teacher creates the exam in Moodle.
2. Students complete the exam on Moodle.
3. Teacher downloads the exam data generated by Moodle (4 files).
4. Teacher upload the 4 files to Moodle Exam Miner.
   1. exam_answers.json
   2. exam_califications.json
   3. exam_logs.json
   4. exam_questions_set.xml
5. Moodle Exam Miner analyses the exam data and generates insights.
6. Teacher receives the final report incluiding interactive graphs and printable PDF.

This is a beta version of the project.  It is currently in development with regular updates. Once it is completed we will let you know and release the official version!

The technology used is **pandas** to deal with data and **plotly** to make interactive graphs of the results.
